  <h1>What is a skateboard?</h1>
    <p>A skateboard is something sick. It is something that is going to change your life in so many ways and I am so upset that you do not already know this.</p>

  <h2>Other websites about skateboarding</h2>
  <p><a href="http://skateboard.about.com/od/skateboardinglifestyle/a/WhyILikeSkate.htm">This is a page about skateboarding</a>. I like that the page is designed to give a quick rundown of a couple aspects of a particular subject. I also like that it lets the reader see the progress they have made on the article. What I don't like is how many different navigation bars are present. It makes everything seem cluttered. I was curious about the "class" syntax in this page's source code. I wonder if it is like how classes are used in other languages, and if this website's layout belongs to a particular class.</p>
